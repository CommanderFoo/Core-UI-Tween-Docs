# Quick Start

If you are only interested in getting straight into using the **UI Tween** API, then follow the below steps.

1. Drag and Drop the **UI_Tween** script onto the script you wish to use it in.
2. Require the **UI_Tween** API.

	```lua
	local UI_Tween = require(script:GetCustomProperty("UI_Tween"))
	```

Now that you have required the **UI_Tween** API, you are ready to use it to start animating any UI.
